BOOK LIBRARY INTERFACE
-----------------------------------------------------

This is a project that aims to create a system for issuing books in libraries.
At the moment, all the basic operations are implemented, and there is also a graphical interface.

The entire project is written entirely in the Rust programming language
using the fltk, chrono, and yaml_rust libraries.
